# L'epique Tetris Clone

Written in C++ with SFML.

## Setup
Built using WSL (Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS on Windows 10 x86_64). Your version may
    differ slightly, but should likely work so long as you have the `apt-get`
    package manager.

1. Run `sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev`
2. Run `make`

Should be good to go. The `Makefile` will automate most of the build process.
